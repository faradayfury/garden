i believe the only way to do good work is to put your heart and soul into it.

after three years of leading design at devfolio, 2586 labs i realized i'd been running so fast that I'd forgotten why I started walking. so I'm taking a sabbatical—not to step away from design, but to step deeper into it.

i'm drawn to the fundamental questions: what does it mean to design with care? how do constraints create beauty? why do some products feel alive while others feel hollow? I find answers not in trends or best practices, but in the quiet observation of how people actually live and what they genuinely need. i design from empathy, build from first principles, and believe that taking care of people—including yourself—is the foundation of meaningful work.

currently, i'm spending my time reading substack, books, writing, learning to code, taking pictures and rediscovering what it means to work with both intensity and balance. i'm fascinated by companies like obsidian and mymind—places where philosophy and product are inseparable.

if you're building something that puts human needs before growth metrics, or if you simply want to chat about why good design feels like coming home, i'd love to hear from you.
